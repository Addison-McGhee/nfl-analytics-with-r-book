### Understanding Linear Regression Results

Using the below example that explores the relationship between an NFL's teams total yards and total points over the course of a season, the results of a linear regression model calculated using the `lm()` function includes the following information (explained afterward):

```{r example-regression-results-explained, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, output = FALSE}

`Residuals:
    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max

```

#### Residuals

A linear model's residuals are the calculated difference between actual values of the dependent values as found in the data used to build the model and those values predicted by the regression model. In a perfect uniform relationship, all of the values from a dataset would sit perfectly on top of the "line of best fit." Take the below graph, for example.

```{r perfect-line-of-fit, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, output = TRUE}

example_fit <- tibble(
  x = 1:10,
  y = 2 * x + 3)

example_perfect_fit <- lm(y ~ x, data = example_fit)

ggplot(example_perfect_fit, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "black", size = .8, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_image(image = "./images/football-tip.png") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks()) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks()) +
  labs(title = "A Perfect Regression Model",
       subtitle = "Every Point Falls on the Line",
       caption = "**An Introduction to NFL Analytics with R**<br>Brad J. Congelio") +
  xlab("Our Predictor Variable") +
  ylab("Our Response Variable") +
  nfl_analytics_theme()
```

In this example model, our regression model was able to successfully capture the entirety of the relationship between `Our Predictor Variable` on the x-axis and the `Our Response Variable` on the y-axis. This means that the model leaves no unexplained or undetermined variance between the variables and, because of this, the model can take additional unused data to predict, with 100% accuracy, the resulting value of the dependent variable. **It is exceedingly rare to have real-world data be perfectly situated on the line of best fit**. In fact, it is more often than not a sign of "overfitting," which occurs when the model successfully discovers the "random noise" in the data. In the majority of cases, a regression model with a perfect line of fit will perform exceedingly poorly when introduced to unseen data.

A regression model that is not "overfitted" will have data points that do not fit on the line of best fit, but fall over and under it. The results of the regression model uses a simple formula - `residual = observed_value - predicted_value` to help us interpret the difference between those actual and estimated values.

The information produced in the example `lm()` summary above includes statistical information about the distribution of the model's residual errors.

|   Summary Distribution    |                                                                                                                                                                          Meaning                                                                                                                                                                          |
|:-----------:|:---------------------------------------------------------:|
|  The `Min` Distribution   |           The `Min` distribution provides the smallest difference between the actual values of the model's predictor variable (total points) and the predicted. In the example summary, **the minimum residual is -71.443 which means that the `lm()` model predicted that one specific team scored 71.443 more points than it actually did.**            |
|   The `1Q` Distribution   |                             The `1Q` distribution is based on the first quartile of the data (or where the first 25% of the model's residual fall on the line of best fit). **The `1Q` residual is -22.334, which means the `lm()` model predicted that 25% of the teams scored 22.334 more points than the actual values.**                              |
| The `Median` Distribution | The `Median` distribution, much like the `1Q` distribution is data from the first quartile, is the residuals from the 50th percentile of the data. **The `Median` residual in the above summary is 1.157, which means that the `lm()` model - for 50% of teams - either overestimated or underestimated a teams total points by less than 1.157 points.** |
|   The `3Q` Distribution   |                                                           Covering the third quartile of the residuals, **the `3Q` Distribution is 19.145 which means that 75% of the NFL teams in the data had a total points prediction either overestimated or underestimated by less than 19.145 points.**                                                            |
|  The `Max` Distribution   |                               The opposite of the `Min` distribution, the `Max` distribution is the largest difference between the model's observed and predicted values for a team's total points. In this case, for one specific team, **the model predicted the team scored 68.080 points less than the actual value.**                                |

::: callout-tip
A model's residuals allow you to quickly get a broad view of how accurately it is predicting the data. Ideally, a well-performing model will return residuals that are small and distributed around zero in a consistent fashion. Residuals that are both small and evenly dispersed around zero are the first sign that the model is making predictions that are close to the actual value in the data and is avoiding both over- and underestimating.

**But this is not always the case**.

For example, we can compare our above example's residuals to the below residual output produced by manually creating a dataset.

```{r creating-example-residuals, echo = TRUE, echo = FALSE, output = TRUE}

set.seed(42)
residual_example <- tibble(
  x = 1:50,
  y = 3 * x + 5 + rnorm(50, mean = 0, sd = 5)
)

residual_example_output <- lm(y ~ x, data = residual_example)

summary(residual_example_output$residuals)
```

Compared to the residuals from the above NFL data, the residuals from the randomly created data are small in comparison and are more evenly distributed around zero. Given that, it is likely that the linear model is doing a good job at making predictions that are close to the actual value.

**But that does not mean the residuals from the NFL data indicate a flawed and unreliable model**. It needs to be noted that the "goodness" of any specific linear regression model is wholly dependent on both the context and the specific problem that the model is attempting to predict. To that end, it is also a matter of trusting your subject matter expertise on matters regarding the NFL.

There could be any number of reasons that can explain why the residuals from the regression model are large and not evenly distributed from zero. For example:

1.  **Red-zone efficiency**: a team that moves the ball downfield with ease, but then struggles to score points once inside the 20-yardline , will accumulate `total_yards` but failed to produce `total_points` in the way the model predicted.
2.  **Turnovers:** Similar to above, a team may rack up `total_yards` but ultimately continue to turn the ball over prior to being able to score.
3.  **Defensive scoring**: a score by a team's defense, in this model, still counts towards `total_points` but does not count towards `total_yards`.
4.  **Strength of Opponent**: At the end of the 2022 season, the Philadelphia Eagles and the New York Jets both allowed just 4.8 yards per play. The model's predicted values of the other three teams in each respective division (NFC East and AFC East) could be incorrect because information, for example, the opponent's strength of defense was not included in the model.

All that to say: residuals are a first glance at the results of the data and provide a **broad** generalization of how the model performed without taking outside contextual factors into consideration.

#### Simple Linear Regression

A simple linear regression is a fundamental statistical technique that is used to explore the relationship between two variables, specifically the dependent variable (also called the "response variable") and the independent variable (also called the "predictor"). By using a simple linear regression, we can model the relationship between the two variables as a linear equation that best fits the observed data points.

A simple linear regression aims to fit a straight line through all the observed data points in such a way that the total squared distance between the actual observations and the values predicted by the model are minimal. This line is often referred to as either the "line of best fit" or the "regression line" and it represents the interaction between the dependent and independent variables. Mathematically, the equation for a simple linear regression is as follows:

$$
Y = {\beta}_0 + {\beta}_1 * X + \epsilon
$$

1.  $Y$, in the above equation, is the dependent variable where the $X$ represents the independent variable.
2.  ${\beta}_o$ is the intercept of the regression model.
3.  ${\beta}_1$ is the slope of the model's "line of best fit."
4.  $\epsilon$ represents the error term.

To better illustrate this, let's use basic football terms using the above regression equation to compare a team's offensive points scored in a season based on how many offensive yards it accumulated. The intercept (${\beta}_o$) represents the value when a team's points scored and offensive yards are both zero. The slope (${\beta}_1$) represents the rate of change in $Y$ as the unit of $X$ changes. The error term ($\epsilon$) is represents the difference between the actual observed values of the regression's dependent variable and the value as predicted by the model.

Using our points scored/total yards example, a team's total yards gained is the **independent variable** and total points scored is the **dependent variable**, as a team's total yardage **is what drives the change in total points** (in other words, a team's total points *is dependent* on its total yardage). A team will not score points in the NFL if it is not also gaining yardage. We can view this relationship by building a simple linear regression model in R using the `lm()` function.

::: callout-note
The `lm()` function is a built-in function in RStudio that stands for "linear model" and is used, as described above, to fit a linear regression to the data that you provide. The completed regression estimates the coefficients of the regression, and also includes both the intercept and slope, which are the main factors in explaining the relationship between your data's response and predictor variables.

The `lm()` function requires just two arguments in order to provide results: a formula and the dataframe to use and is structured like so: `model_results <- lm(formula, data)`.

The `formula` argument require that you specify both the response and predictor variables, as named in your dataframe, in the structure of `Y ~ X`(wherein `Y` is the response variables and `X` is the predictor). In the case that you have more than one predictor variable, the `+` is used to add to the formula (`lm(Y ~ X1 + X2`).

The `lm()` function returns the coefficients, residuals, and other statistics of the model in a `lm` data object. There are There are numerous ways to access this data which are discussed in further detail below.
:::

Let's build a simple linear regression model that explores the relationship between the total yardage earned by a team over the course of a season and the number of points scored. To begin, place the prepared data in the `simple_regression_data` dataframe by running the code below.

```{r load-simple-regression-data, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, output = FALSE}

simple_regression_data <- vroom::vroom("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcongelio/nfl-analytics-with-r-book/origin/example_data/csv/simple_regression_data.csv")

simple_regression_data
```

The data contains the total yardage and points scored for each NFL team between 2012 and 2022. The data does not include any playoff games. Before running a model on all ten years of data, we will begin by selecting just information from 2022 and then build our `lm()` model.

```{r lm-model-2022, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, output = FALSE}

regression_2022 <- simple_regression_data %>%
  filter(season == 2022)

results_2022 <- lm(total_points ~ total_yards, data = regression_2022)
```

Using the `lm()` function, the $Y$ variable (the dependent) is `total_yards` and the $X$ variable (the predictor) is entered as `total_yards` with the argument that the `data` is coming from the `regression_2022` dataframe stored in the RStudio environment. We can view the results of the regression model by using the `summary()` function.

```{r viewing-regression-summary, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, output = TRUE}

summary(results_2022)
```

While residuals are not the only summary statistics to examine in the results, they do provide a broad way to understand how the linear model performed. In this case, the residuals have a wide spread and an inconsistent deviation from zero. While the `median` residual value is the closest to zero at 1.157, it is still a bit too high to safely conclude that the model is making predictions that adequately reflect the actual values. Moreover, both tail ends of the residual values (`Min` and `Max`) are a large negative and positive number, respectively, which is a possible indication that both over- and underestimating a team's `total_points` by statistically significant amount.

However, as mentioned in this chapter's explanation of how to interpret residuals from a model's summary statistics, the widespread and deviation from zero in the results is likely the result of numerous factors outside the model's purview that occur in any one NFL game. To get a better idea of what the residual values represent, we can plot the data and include NFL team logos.

```{r plotting-residual-values, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, output = TRUE}

ggplot(regression_2022, aes(x = total_yards, y = residuals)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "black", linewidth = .7) +
  stat_fit_residuals(size = 0.01) +
  stat_fit_deviations(size = 1.75, color = regression_2022$team_color) +
  geom_image(aes(image = team_logo_wikipedia), asp = 16/9, size = .0325) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(),
                     labels = scales::comma_format()) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 5)) +
  labs(title = "**Total Yards & Residual Values**",
       subtitle = "*Y = total_points ~ total_yards*",
       caption = "*An Introduction to NFL Analytic with R*<br>Brad J. Congelio") +
  xlab("Total Yards") +
  ylab("Residual of Total Points") +
  nfl_analytics_theme() +
  theme(panel.grid.minor.y = element_line(color = "#d0d0d0"))
```

With the data visualized, it is clear that the model's `Min` distribution of -71.44 is associated with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, while the `Max` distribution of 68.08 is the prediction for the total points earned by the Dallas Cowboys. Because a negative residual means that the model's predicted value is too high, and a positive residual means it was too low, we can conclude that the Buccaneers actually scored 71.4 points less than the the results of the model, while the Cowboys scored 68.08 more than predicted.

```{r showing-coefficient-lm, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, output = FALSE}

`Coefficients:
              Estimate Std. Error t value      Pr(>|t|)    
(Intercept) -225.03520   65.44927  -3.438       0.00174 ** 
total_yards    0.10341    0.01132   9.135 0.00000000036 ***
---
Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1`

```

The `(Intercept)` of the model, or where the regression line crosses the y-axis, is -225.0350. When working with NFL data, it of course does not make sense that the `(Intercept)` is negative. Given the model is built on a team's total yards and total points, it seems intuitive that the regression line would cross the y-axis at the point of (0,0) as an NFL team not gaining any yards is highly unlike to score any points.

It is important to remember that the linear model attempts to position the regression line to come as close to all the individual points as possible. Because of this, it is not uncommon for regression line to not cross exactly where the x-axis and y-axis meet. Again, contextual factors of an NFL game are not account for in the model's data: strength of the opponent's defense, the quality of special teams play, defensive turnovers and/or touchdowns, field position, etc. can all impact a team's ability to score points without gaining any yardage. The lack of this information in the data ultimately impact the positioning of the line of best fit.

The `total_yards` coefficient represents the slope of the model's regression line. It is this slope that represents how a team's total points are predicted to change with every additional gain of one yard. In this example, the `total_yards` coefficient is 0.10341 - so for every additional yard gained by a team, it is expected to add 0.10341 points to the team's cumulative amount.

The `Std. Error` summary statistic provides guidance on the accuracy of the other estimated coefficients. The `Std. Error` for the model's `(Intercept)` is quite large at 65.44927. Given the ability to resample the data from NFL terms numerous times and then allowing the linear model to predict again, this specific `Std. Error` argues that the regression line will cross the y-axis with 65.44972 of -225.03520 in either direction. Under normal circumstances, a large `Std. Error` for the `(Intercept)` would cause concern about the validity of the regression line's crossing point. However, given the nature of this data - an NFL team cannot score negative points - we should not have any significant concern about the large `Std. Error` summary statistic for the `(Intercept)`.

At 0.01132, the `Std. Error` for the `total_yards` coefficient is small and indicates that the `Estimate` of `total_yards` - that is, the increase in points per every yard gained - is quite accurate. Given repeated re-estimating of the data, the relationship between `total_yards` and `total_points` would vary by just 0.01132, either positively or negatively.

With a `t-value` of 9.135, the `total_yards` coefficient has a significant relationship with `total_points`. The A value of -3.438 indicates that the `(Intercept)` is statistically different from 0 but we should still largely ignore this relationship given the nature of the data.

The model's `Pr(>|t|)` value of highly significant for `total_yards` and is still quite strong for the `(Intercept)`. The value of 0.00000000036 indicates an incredibly significant relationship between `total_yards` and `total_points`.

The linear model's `Residual Standard Error` is 32.04, which means that the average predicted values of `total_points` are 32.04 points different from the actual values in the data. The linear model was able to explain 73.56% of the variance between `total_yards` and `total_points` based on the `multiple R-squared` value of 0.7356. Additionally, the `Adjusted R-squared` value of 0.7268 is nearly identical to the multiple R2, which is a sign that the linear model is not overfitting (in this case because of the simplicity of the data). The model's `F-Statistic` of 83.45 indicates a overall significance to the data, which is backed up by an extremely strong `p-value`.

Based on the summary statistics, the linear model did an extremely good job at capturing the relationship between a team's `total_yards` and `total_points`. However, with residuals ranging from -71.443 to 68.080, it is likely that the model can be improved upon by adding additional information and statistics. However, before providing additional metrics, we can try to improve the model's predictions by including all of the data (rather than just the 2022 season). By including 20-seasons worth of `total_yards` and `total_points`, we are increasing the sample size which, in theory, allows for a reduced impact of any outliers and an improve generalizability.

::: callout-important
Working with 10+ years of play-by-play data can be problematic in that them model, using just `total_yards` and `total_points`, is not aware of changes in the overall style of play NFL. The balance between rushing and passing has shifted, there's been a philosophical shift in the coaching ranks in "going for it" on 4th down, etc. A simple linear regression cannot account for how these shifts impact the data on a season-by-season basis.
:::

The results from including the `total_points` and `total_yards` for each NFL team from 2012-2022 show an improvement of the model, specifically with the residual values.

```{r all-seasons-regression, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, output = FALSE}

regression_all_seasons <- simple_regression_data %>%
  select(-season)

all_season_results <- lm(total_points ~ total_yards, data = regression_all_seasons)

summary(all_season_results)
```

Without further testing, the residual values after including 20-seasons worth of data are a bit better. The `Median` is -1.26 which is slightly higher than just one season (`M` = 1.16). The `1Q` and `3Q` distributions are both approximately symmetric around the model's `M` value compared to just the 2022 season regression that results in a deviation between `1Q` and `3Q` (-22.33 and 19.15, respectively). The `Min` and `Max` values of the new model still indicate longtail cases on both ends of the regression line much like the 2022 model found.

::: callout-tip
To further examine the residual values, we can use a **Shapiro-Wilk Test** to test the whether results are normally distributed.

The Shapiro-Wilk Test provides two values with the output: the test statistic (provided as a `W` score) and the model's `p-value`. Scores for `W` can range between 0 and 1, where results closer to 1 meaning the residuals are in a normal distribution. The `p-value` is used make decision on the null hypothesis (that there *is* enough evidence to conclude that there is uneven distribution). In most cases, if the `p-value` is larger than the regression's level of significance (typically 0.05), than you may **reject** the null hypothesis.

We can run the Shapiro-Wilk Test on our 2012-2022 data using the `shapiro.test` function that is part of the `stats` package in R.

```{r running-shapiro-wilk, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, output = FALSE}

results_2012_2020 <- residuals(all_season_results)

shapiro_test_result <- shapiro.test(results_2012_2020)

shapiro_test_result

```

The `W` score for the residual is 1, meaning a very strong indication that the data in our model is part of a normal distribution. The `p-value` is 0.8, which is much large than the regression's level of significance (0.05). As a result, we can reject the null hypothesis and again conclude that the data is in a normal distribution.
:::

Using the Shapiro-Wilk Test to confirm the normal distribution of the data is help because, if plotted, the model that covers 20-seasons worth of data is harder to visually interpret than just one season as the plot increases from just 32 data points to 640, with many overlapping.

```{r plotting-all-season-residuals, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, output = TRUE}

teams <- nflreadr::load_teams(current = TRUE)

regression_all_seasons <- left_join(regression_all_seasons, teams, by = c("team" = "team_abbr"))

regression_all_seasons$residuals <- residuals(all_season_results)

ggplot(regression_all_seasons, aes(x = total_yards, y = residuals)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "black", linewidth = .7) +
  stat_fit_residuals(size = 2, color = regression_all_seasons$team_color) +
  stat_fit_deviations(size = 1, color = regression_all_seasons$team_color, alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(),
                     labels = scales::comma_format()) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 5)) +
  labs(title = "**Total Yards & Residual Values: 2012-2022**",
       subtitle = "*Y = total_points ~ total_yards*",
       caption = "*An Introduction to NFL Analytic with R*<br>Brad J. Congelio") +
  xlab("Total Yards") +
  ylab("Residual of Total Points") +
  nfl_analytics_theme() +
  theme(panel.grid.minor.y = element_line(color = "#d0d0d0"))

```

We can also compare the multiple R2 and adjusted R2 score between the two regression models.

    2012 - 2022 Data:
    Multiple R-squared:  0.683
    Adjusted R-squared:  0.682

    2022 Data
    Multiple R-squared:  0.736
    Adjusted R-squared:  0.727

The regression using just the 2022 data results in a slightly better multiple and adjusted R2 score compared to using data from the last twenty seasons of the NFL. While this does indicate that the model based on the single season is better at defining the relationship between a team's `total_yards` and `total_points` it is essential to remember that there is different underlying patterns in the data as a result of the changing culture in the NFL and, ultimately, the epp and flow of team performance as a result of high levels of parity in the league.

In order to account for this "epp and flow" in both team performance and the changing culture/rules of the NFL, we need to turn to a multiple linear regression in include these additional factors as it is a model that is capable of better accounting for the nuances of NFL data.

#### Multiple Linear Regression

A multiple linear regression is extremely similar to a simple linear regression (both in design and how to create one in RStudio). The main difference, as discussed, is that a multiple linear regression allows for us to include additional predictor variables by using the `+` sign in the model's formula. The inclusion fo these additional predictive variables, in theory, allow the model to compute the more complex relationships in NFL data and improve its final performance.

We will again create our first multiple linear regression with just data from the 2022 season that includes the same predictor (`total_yards`) and response variable (`total_points`). For additional predictors, we must consider what circumstances may lead a team to have high `total_yardage` but an amount of `total_points` that would fall below the model's predicted value. We will include as additional predictors:

1.  **Redzone Efficiency:** provided as a percentage, this is a calculation of how many times a team drove into the red zone and scored. A higher percentage is better.

## Creating Our Own Rushing Yards Over Expected Model

Back in January of 2021, Tej Seth posted an article to the [Michigan Football Analytics Society blog](https://mfootballanalytics.com/2021/01/14/creating-a-public-expected-rushing-yards-model/) that outlined his vision for creating a "public expected rushing yards model." The structure of his model, as explained by Tej, was inspired by the prior work of Michael Egle, an honorable mention in both the 2021 and 2023 NFL Big Data Bowl, who previously used the college football equivalent of open-source data ([`cfbfastR`](https://cfbfastr.sportsdataverse.org/)) to create an RYOE model for the collegiate game.[^05-nfl-analytics-advanced-methods-1] In Tej's case, his approach to created an NFL-centric RYOE model culminated with the creation of his [RYOE Shiny App](https://mfbanalytics.shinyapps.io/RYOE/) that allows anybody to explore his RYOE metric by season or team and even through three-way rusher comparisons.

[^05-nfl-analytics-advanced-methods-1]: Thanks to Tej Seth for briefly chatting with me over Twitter regarding the history of both Michael's RYOE model and his own.

Despite a slightly intimidating title, rushing yards over expected is a fantastic entrypoint into exploring model creation and analysis in NFL analytics - in fact, the growing number of "over expected" metrics in the NFL are all great ways to begin learning about and understanding advanced modeling. Robby Greerre, the owner of [nfeloapp.com](https://www.nfeloapp.com/) - a website that provides "data-driven analytics, picks, and predictions for the NFL" - explains that over expected metrics are a increasingly popular avenue in which analysts can "paint a more accurate picture of performance by adjusting familiar statistics like 'completion percentage' or 'yards per rush' for conflating factors like degree of difficulty or game text" [@nfelo].

Some of these metrics, like completion percentage over expected (CPOE), are widely accepted. Specifically, CPOE calculates how likely any quarterback's pass is going to be complete or incomplete compared to other passing attempts. It is considered "widely accepted" because the metric itself is considered "stable" in that the r-squared value retains a strong correlation for individual quarterbacks across several seasons. In fact, as Greerre points out, the r-squared value for CPOE for just one season is 0.226 which is extremely strong based on NFL analytics standards.

On the other hand, RYOE - based on Greerre's analysis - maintains an r-squared value below 0.15 until a running back's fourth season, wherein the average improves to 0.263 (an otherwise stable value). But that does not mean that RYOE is not a metric worth further exploration. The effectiveness of any one metric to account for factors such as degree of difficulty or game text largely relies on our ability to provide adequate feature engineering - specifically, how much relevant data the machine learning model can ingest to begin making predictions.

Because of that, significant machine learning models have been built with information provided by the NFL's Big Data Bowl as it is the one chance that the public receives to feature engineer with the NFL's tracking data (wherein a player's position, speed, direction, etc. is tracked and recorded every 1/10th of a second). Unfortunately, only small windows of data exist from the Big Data Bowl releases and, as a result, we are often required to find creative ways to provide further context to each play/player for the machine learning model.

To showcase this idea, we are going to begin exploring ways to add additional feature engineering to Tej Seth's already fantastic Rushing Yard Over Expected model. While not the most stable metric, as mentioned, the idea of RYOE is generally easy to understand for even the most analyst. Broadly, given what we know about every other rushing play during a specific span of seasons, what is the most likely amount of yards a running back is going to gain on a specific rushing play as predicted by the model on other similar situations?

**That difference is rushing yards over expected**.

Using Tej's Shiny app, we can explore all seasons between 2015 and 2022 for those running backs that had a minimum of 755 rushing attempts.

```{r tej-seth-shiny-results, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Credit: Tej Seth"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ryoe_2015_2022.jpg"))
```

According to Tej's model, since 2015, Nick Chubb of the Cleveland Browns earned - on average - 0.66 over expected. Aaron Jones is closely behind with 0.61 over expected and then a significant drop occurs for the third and fourth players.

To understand how Tej engineered his model and to begin exploring other possible features to feed into the model, we can dive into his [publicly available code](https://github.com/tejseth/RYOE/blob/main/ryoe-2.R).

### Tej Seth's RYOE Model: Under The Hood

::: callout-important
It is important to immediately point out that Tej built his RYOE model using the `xgboost` package whereas we will begin constructing ours using `tidymodels`.

While the underlying eXtreme Gradient Boosting process is largely the same with both approaches, the necessary framework we will construct with `tidymodels` differs *greatly* from the coding used with the `xgboost` package.

The `xgboost` package is a standalone package in R that provide an implementation of the eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithm. To that end, it offers a highly efficient and flexible way to train gradient boosting models for various machine learning tasks, such as classification, regression, and ranking. The package provides its own set of functions for training, cross-validation, prediction, and feature importance evaluation.

The `tidymodels` package, on the other hand, is a *collection* of R packages that provide a unified framework for modeling and machine learning tasks. It includes several package for data preprocessing, modeling, validation, and evaluation. Because of this, the core goal of the `tidymodels` teams is to offer a consistent syntax and workflow for a wide range of machine learning models. It is a fair comparison to say that `tidymodels` is the `tidyverse` of the machine learning world.
:::

Just like the model we will be building in this chapter, Tej constructed his model via eXtreme Gradient Boosting.

Which may lead to a very obvious question if you are new to machine learning: **what exactly *is* eXtreme Gradient Boosting?**

### eXtreme Gradient Boosting Explained

eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is a powerful machine learning technique that is particularly good at solving supervised machine learning problems, such as classification (categorizing data into classes, for example) and regression (predicting numerical values).

XGBoost can be thought of as an "expert team" that combines the knowledge and skills of multiple "individual experts" to make better decisions or predictions. Each of these "experts" in this context is what we call a decision tree, which is a flowchart structure used for making decisions based on a series of question about the data.

Once provided data, XGBoost seeks to iteratively build a collection of "bad" decision trees and then build an ensemble of these poor ones into a more accurate and robust model. The term "gradient" comes from the fact that the algorithm uses the gradient (or the slope) of the loss function (a measure of how well the model fits the data) to guide the learning process.

## Navigating the NFL's Big Data Bowl

lots of place holding for Big Data Bowl material below

Thomas Bliss, a Data Scientist with the NFL, [provided an incredibly helpful list of potential topics](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2023/discussion/365497) that can be explored using 2023 Big Data Bowl information:

1.  analyze blocker positioning after the QB leaves the pocket and/or is pressured
2.  analyze blocker ability to hold a defender in place without moving towards the QB
3.  link the rate of false starts to an offensive line's time off the snap
4.  link between QB release time, receiver separation, and offensive line performance
