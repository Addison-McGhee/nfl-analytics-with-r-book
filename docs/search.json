    "section": "\n1.1 Overview of Chapters",
    "text": "1.1 Overview of Chapters\n\nChapter 1 provides an overview of the nflverse with specific attention paid to the difference between using nflfastR versus nflreadr. Serving as the first dive into analytics, the chapter showcases how to use nflreadr to retrieve both compiled weekly NFL stats and the deeply robust play-by-play statistics. In both cases, exercises are provided. Readers will do their first coding by, first, using the weekly stats to determine the 2021 leaders in air yards per attempt. Second, readers will use the play-by-play statistics from the 2021 season to create a brand new metric (QB aggressiveness on 3rd down pass attempts). Afterward, readers will learn how to retrieve multiple seasons of data at once.\nChapter 2 covers the process of downloading both R and RStudio, as well as the necessary packages to do NFL analytics. As one of the most important chapters in the book (especially for those new to the R programming language), readers take a deep dive into wrangling NFL data with the tidyverse package. To begin, readers will learn about the dplyr pipe (%>%) and use, in exercises, the six most important verbs in the dplyr language: filer(), select(), arrange(), summarize(), mutate(), and group_by(). At the conclusion of the chapter, multiple exercises are provided to allow readers to practice using the dplyr verbs, relational operators within the filter() function and creating “new stats” by using the summarize() function. Moreover, readers will determine the relationship between the dplyr language and important variables within the nflverse data such as player_name and player_id, which is important for correct manipulation and cleaning of data.\nChapter 3 examines the numerous and, often, bewildering amount of functions “underneath the hood” of the packages that makes up the nflverse. For example, load_pbp() and load_player_stats() are included in both nflfastR and nflreadr. However, load_nextgen_stats(), load_pfr_stats(), and load_contracts() are all part of just nflreadr. Because of this complexity, readers will learn how to efficiently operate within the nflverse. Moreover, chapter 3 provides dozens of examples and exercises related to all of the various functions included. For example, readers will learn to use load_nextgen_stats() to determine which running backs get to the line of scrimmage the quickest and will use load_pfr_stats() to explore advanced defensive metrics across multiple seasons.\nChapter 4 moves readers from data cleaning and manipulation to an introduction to data visualization using ggplot2. As well, chapter 4 provides further instruction on nflverse functions such as clean_player_names(), clean_team_abbrs(), and clean_homeaway(). As well, to prep for data visualization, readers will be introduced to the teams_colors_logos and load_rosters functions as well as the nflplotR package, which provides “functions and geoms to help visualization of NFL related analysis” (Carl 2022). Readers will produce multiple types of visualizations, including geom_bar, geom_point, geom_density, and more. As well, readers will learn to use facet_wrap and facet_grid to display data over multiple seasons. For visualizations that include team logos or player headshots, instruction will cover both how to do the coding manually using teams_colors_logos or load_rosters and to use the nflplotr package to avoid the need to use left_join to merge teams_colors_logos to your dataframe.\nChapter 5 introduces advanced methods in R using nflverse data, with a specific focus on modeling and machine learning. To streamline the process of learning, readers will be introduced to tidymodels, a “collection of packages for modeling and machine learning using tidyverse principles” (Silge, n.d.). As an example, readers will first be introduced to Tej Seth’s Rushing Yards Over Expected model (GitHub, ShinyApp). The model will serve as a learning tool to help readers understand the relationship between nflfastR data and machine learning (in Tej’s case, an xgboost model). Afterward, specific attention is given to binary classification, multiclass classification, and regression computer learning models. At the conclusion of the chapter, readers will be provided exercises to allow them to develop their own supervised and unsupervised machine learning models.\nChapter 6 introduces data from sources outside of the nflverse, including premium statistics from Pro Football Focus and Sports Info Solutions. Readers will learned to use various functions, such as clean_team_names, in order to prepare the data to merge with data from the nflverse. As well, this chapter will introduce readers to working with player tracking data. To do so, data will be provided from the NFL’s Big Data Bowl. To highlight the work being completed using player tracking, this chapter will discuss the Big Data Bowl entries of Matt Ploenzke (The Importance of Ball Carrier Downfield Acceleration and Unblocked Tackler Distance and Spacing) and the team of Kellin Rumsey & Brandon DeFlon (The Battle Between Blocker and Defender Is Often Decided by Leverage)."

    "text": "About The Author\nI (Bradley Congelio) am currently an Assistant Professor in the College of Business at Kutztown University of Pennsylvania. Aside from my core area of instruction, I also instruct the very popular Sport Analytics (SPT 313) course.\nI earned my Ph.D. from the University of Western Ontario and received a specialized certificate in R for Data Analytics from the University of California, San Diego in 2021. I am a proud undergraduate alumni of West Liberty University and am a strong advocate of a broad-based liberal arts education.\nMy research focuses on using big data, the R programming language, and analytics to explore the impact of professional stadiums on neighboring communities. I use the proprietary Zillow ZTRAX database as well as U.S. Census and other forms of data to create robust, applied, and useful insight into how best to protect those living in areas where stadiums are proposed for construction.\nAs well, my work in sport analytics, specifically the NFL, has been featured on numerous media outlets, including the USA Today and Sports Illustrated.\nFinally, my most recent academic, peer-reviewed publications include:\n\nCongelio, B. (2022). ’Examining the Impact of New Stadium Construction on Local Property Prices Using Data Analytics and the Zillow ZTRAX Database.” Journal of Business, Economics, and Technology Spring 2022, 39-55.\nCongelio, B. (2021). “Monitoring the Policing of Olympic Host Cities: A Novel Approach Using Data Analytics and the LA2028 Olympic Summer Games.” Journal of Olympic Studies 2(2), 129-145.\nCongelio, B. “Predicting the Impact of a New Stadium on Surrounding Neighborhoods Through the Use of a k-means Unsupervised Clustering Algorithm.” Currently under peer review.\nCongelio, B. “Examining Megaevent’s Impact on Foot Traffic to Local Businesses Using Mobility and Demographic Aggregation Data.” Currently under peer review and funded by a $15,000 grant.\n\n\n1.1.1 Why A Book Instead of Working in Analytics?\nI am sometimes asked why I spend time in the classroom teaching this material rather than taking my domain knowledge to the “industry side” and working in the NFL or an otherwise NFL-connected outlet.\nThe honest and, likely boring, answer is this: I love teaching. My favorite experience in the classroom yet is always in my Sport Analytics course. The frustration and sense of helplessness is palpable in the first weeks of the semester as students attempt to wrap their head around, what a former student called, “this [censored] foreign language.” I insist that they keep pushing through the exercises and assignments. Often, there is line out my door and extending down the hallway during office hours comprised of just students from the Sport Analytics class.\nAnd then something amazing happens.\nTypically about halfway through the semester, I start seeing the light bulbs go off. Instead of cursing in anger at the “foreign language,” students begin randomly cursing in excitement as the flow of the tidyverse language “clicks.” Once that happens, it is off to the races because, once they understand speaking in tidyverse, learning more difficult packages (like tidymodels) seems doable.\nAnd that is why I teach. That moment where I realize my lecturing, assisting, explaining, and gentle nudging are all finally paying dividends - not for me, though. For the students.\nThis book serves as an extension of that classroom experience. As a reader of this book, you are now a “student” and I hope you do not hesitate to reach out to me if you ever have any questions or, more importantly, when (not if) you have that “light bulb moment” and everything begins to click for you."

    "section": "\n2.2 2021 NFL Completion Leaders",
    "text": "2.2 2021 NFL Completion Leaders\nAt the conclusion of the 2021 NFL season, Tom Brady - of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers - led the league in completed pass attempts with 485, well above Justin Herbert’s tally of 443 completions for second place. However, as is the case with many NFL statistics, there is much context that can be added to even an otherwise “simple statistic” such as pass completions.\nFor example, one may be interested in seeing the progression of completion throughout the season to witness how the “race to the top” changed from week to week. And, of course, all completions are not created equal. Was Tom Brady doing a “nickel and dime” routine down the field, thus picking up easier completions than, for example, a QB slinging it 15+ yards at a higher rate than Brady? Or what about a quarterback’s time to throw? It seems logical to conclude that an under performing offensive line, providing limited time for a QB to make reads and get rid of the ball, would impact multiple parts of a QB’s passing game.\nTo start exploring some of these questions and assumptions, lets pull the prepared data from this book’s GitHub using the following code:\n\ncompleted_passes <- readr::read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcongelio/nfl-analytics-with-r-book/origin/example_data/completed_passes.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe readr package is part of the tidyverse. Please make sure to run library(tidyverse) to load both.\n\n\nThe data is a snippet of NFL play-by-play from the nflreadr package with 18 variables included:\n\ncolnames(completed_passes)\n\n[1] \"player_id\"           \"player_display_name\" \"recent_team\"        \n[4] \"week\"                \"season_type\"         \"completions\"        \n[7] \"passing_air_yards\"  \n\n\n\n2.2.1 Week-by-Week Completed Passes\nWas Tom Brady near the top of the completion leader board throughout the 2021 NFL season? Or did he perhaps jump at the leader board with an above-average number of completions in the final weeks of the season?\nTo answer this question, we can create a week-by-week graph after doing several basic manipulations to the data. First, the code:\n\nweek_by_week <- completed_passes %>%\n  filter(season_type == \"REG\") %>%\n  group_by(player_id) %>%\n  mutate(all_completions = sum(completions, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  filter(all_completions >= 372) %>%\n  summarize(total_completions = cumsum(completions),\n            week = week,\n            name = player_display_name,\n            posteam = recent_team)\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'player_id'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\nThere are several things going on in the above example.\nFirst, we are using the filter function from dplyr to calculate completed passes from just the regular season. In order to calculate for each individual quarterback, we are using the group_by function to lump all distinct player_id together. Afterwards, we are creating a new column within the data with mutate titled all_completions which is the sum of all complete passes for each quarterback. This is done in order to efficiently use the filter function to limit the results to just the top ten quarterbacks by total completions. Lastly, we use the summarize function to distill the data down to four columns. Of importance is the total_completions column we create using the cumsum function, which adds each QB’s completions week-by-week for a running total. After, we grab the week, name, and posteam columns for the purposes of data visualization.\nYou can see the first ten rows of the data by simply typing the name of the dataframe and running it: week_by_week.\nWith the data manipulation complete, let’s take the information and visualize it by cumulative completions by week for each quarterback. But, first, to allow for differentiation, lets bring in team colors into the dataframe using the team_colors_logos function within the nflfastR package:\n\nweek_by_week <- week_by_week %>%\n  left_join(nflfastR::teams_colors_logos, by = c(\"posteam\" = \"team_abbr\"))\n\nBy matching up the team_abbr listed within teams_colors_logos to the posteam in our dataframe, we are able to match each quarterback to their respective team colors, logos, and more. With that completed, we can turn to completing the data visualization:\n\nggplot(data = week_by_week, aes(x = week, y = total_completions, group = player_id)) +\n  geom_line(color = week_by_week$team_color, size = 1.5) +\n  geom_point(color = week_by_week$team_color2, size = 1) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1,18,1),\n                     expand = c(0,0)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks()) +\n  theme(aspect.ratio = 9 / 16) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"#FFFFFF\"),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#FFFFFF\"),\n    panel.border = element_rect(color = \"#FFFFFF\"),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"#F3F3F3\", size = .75),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 11, color = \"#535353\", family = \"Roboto Condensed\"),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 11, color = \"#535353\", family = \"Roboto Condensed\"),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 11, color = \"#535353\", family = \"Roboto Condensed\"),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 11, color = \"#535353\", family = \"Roboto Condensed\"),\n    axis.ticks = element_blank()) +\n  ylab(\"Total Completions\") +\n  xlab(\"Week\") +\n  labs(title = \"Cumulative Completions per Week\",\n       subtitle = \"2021 Season\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2021 Cumulative Completions"

Despite that philosophical gap, the three elements provided by Stikeleather are succinct enough to allow us to build a framework in this chapter for how to successfully craft an NFL analytics data visualization. In his piece, Stikeleather outlines the following three characteristics of a successful data visualization: it understands the audience, it sets up a clear framework, and it tells a story (Stikeleather 2013).\nTo illustrate the importance of these three elements, let’s take a look at example visualizations using NFL data to further contextualize each one."

    "section": "\n5.1 Data Viz Must Understand the Audience",
    "text": "5.1 Data Viz Must Understand the Audience\nAs explained by Stikeleather, the core purpose of a data visualization is to take “great quantities of information” and then convey that information in such a way that it is “easily assimilated by the consumers of the information.” In other words, the process of data visualization should allow for a great quantity of data to be distilled into an easily consumable (and understandable!) format.\nSpeaking specifically to NFL analytics, when doing visualizations we must be conscious about whether or not the intended audience will understand the terminology and concepts we use in the plot. For example, most all NFL fans understand the “non-advanced” statistics in the sport. But, when plots start using metrics such as EPA or completion percentage over expected, for example, the audience looking at the plot may very well have little understanding of what is being conveyed.\nBecause of this, any data viz I create never fails to include “directables” within the plot. These “directables” may be arrows that indicate which trend on the plot are “good” or they can be text within a scatterplot that explains what each quadrant means. Or, for example, I sometimes include a textual explanation of the “equation” used to develop a metric as seen below:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above plot explores which QBs, from the 2020 season, were most aggressive on 3rd down with between 5 to 10 yards to go. Since “aggressiveness” is not a typical, day-to-day metric discussed by NFL fans, I included a “directable” within the subtitle of the plot that explained that the plot, first, was examining just 3rd down pass attempts within a specific yard range. And, second, I made the decision to include how “aggressiveness” was calculated by including the simple equation within the subtitle as well. Doing so allows even the most casual of NFL fans to easily understand what the plot is showing - in this case, that Joe Burrow’s 3rd down pass attempts with between 5 to 10 yards to go made it to the line of gain, or more, on 68% of his attempts. On the other hand, Drew Lock and Drew Brees were the least aggressive QBs in the line based on the same metric.\nAs another example, below is what I deemed my “Uncle Rico Metric” (because who does not like a good Napoleon Dynamite reference?):"

Reviewers given access to the earliest version of this book suggest a “Football 101” section to bring people up to speed on analytics and definitions of those analytics. This is going to serve as that reference point, and also include a “quick reference guide” on how to find/calculate the metrics within the nflverse. Before are just a couple examples of how I see this section being displayed."

    "text": "A.1 Air Yards\nAir yards is the measure that the ball travels through the air, from the line of scrimmage, to the exact point where the wide receivers catches, or does not catch, the football. It does not take into consideration the amount of yardage gained after the catch by the wide receiver (which would be yards after catch).\nFor an example, please see the below illustration. In it, the line of scrimmag is at the 20-yardline. The QB completes a pass that is caught at midfield (the 50-yardline). After catching the football, the wide receiver is able to advance the ball down to the opposing 30-yardline before getting tackled. First and foremost, the quarterback is credited with a total of 50 passing yards on the play, while the wide receiver is credited with the same.\nHowever, because air yards is a better metric to explore a QB’s true impact on a play, he is credited with 30 air yards while the wide receiver is credited with 20 yards after catch.\nIn the end, quarterbacks with higher air yards per attempt are generally assumed to be throwing the ball deeper downfield than QBs with lower air yards per attempt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are multiple ways to collect data pertaining to air yards. However, the most straightforward way is to use load_player_stats:\n\ndata <- nflreadr::load_player_stats(2021)\n\nair.yards <- data %>%\n  filter(season_type == \"REG\") %>%\n  group_by(player_id) %>%\n  summarize(\n    attempts = sum(attempts),\n    name = first(player_name),\n    air.yards = sum(passing_air_yards),\n    avg.ay = mean(passing_air_yards)) %>%\n  filter(attempts >= 100) %>%\n  select(name, air.yards, avg.ay) %>%\n  arrange(-air.yards)\n\ntibble(air.yards)\n\n# A tibble: 42 x 3\n   name       air.yards avg.ay\n   <chr>          <dbl>  <dbl>\n 1 T.Brady         5821   342.\n 2 J.Allen         5295   311.\n 3 M.Stafford      5094   300.\n 4 D.Carr          5084   299.\n 5 J.Herbert       5069   298.\n 6 P.Mahomes       4825   284.\n 7 T.Lawrence      4732   278.\n 8 D.Prescott      4612   288.\n 9 K.Cousins       4575   286.\n10 J.Burrow        4225   264.\n# ... with 32 more rows\n\n\nIn the above example, we can see that Tom Brady led the NFL during the 2021 regular season with a comined total of 5,821 air yards which works out to an average of 342 air yards per game."

    "text": "A.2 Average Depth of Target\nAs mentioned above, a QB’s air yards per attempt can highlight whether or not he is attempting to push the ball deeper down field than his counterparts. The official name of this is Average Depth of Target (or ADOT).
