# Errata {#sec-appendix-errata}

While every effort was made to write and produce a clean book (from both myself and the copyediting team at CRC Press), it is likely that minor issues go unnoticed or resources used in this book change locations (such as URLs pointed to specific data, etc.).

Because of this, this page enumerates errors in the print version of *Introduction to NFL Analytics with R*. Please notify me if you find issues (typos, lack of figure captions, issues with variables names, incorrect URLs, etc.) so that I may keep the online version updated here.

-   **Chapter 5** (p. 241): Both variables are labeled as `total_yards`. The Y (dependent variable) should be `total_points` and the X (predictor variable) should remain `total_yards`.
